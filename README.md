# 🚀 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
Welcome to my DSA repository, where I document my journey of learning and implementing Data Structures and Algorithms! 💡

<p> 📌 About </p>
This repository contains my solutions, notes, and implementations of various DSA concepts in [your programming language, e.g., Python, C++, Java]. It serves as a learning resource and a way to track my progress. <br>

<br>📂 Folder Structure</p>
Arrays & Strings – Basic operations, sorting, searching
Linked Lists – Single, Double, Circular Linked Lists
Stacks & Queues – Implementation, Applications
Recursion & Backtracking – Problems & Techniques
Trees & Graphs – Traversal, BFS, DFS, Shortest Path Algorithms
Dynamic Programming – Memoization, Tabulation
Sorting & Searching – QuickSort, MergeSort, Binary Search <br>

<br>🏆 Goals</p>
✔ Solve at least X problems per week
✔ Implement important algorithms from scratch
✔ Participate in coding challenges (LeetCode, CodeChef, etc.) <br>

<br>📖 Resources </p> 
Data Structures & Algorithms - <br>
GeeksforGeeks <br>
LeetCode <br>
InterviewBit <br>

<br>💡 Contributions </p>
This repository is for personal learning, but feel free to suggest improvements or discuss solutions!
